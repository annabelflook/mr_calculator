# M<sub>r</sub> Calculator
A calculator that returns the molecular weight of many chemical compounds given a molecular formula in string format.

### General Information
I undertook this project in an early attempt to explore REGEX. As with all regular expressions, the ones used in this code are complex and I encourage users to have a glance at them. I write, at length, about my time developing this piece of code in my blog: www.runinswithpython.co.uk/post/regex-my-first-real-project.

### Technologies
Written orginally for Python 3.7, this code is supported by all versions of Python 3.x and requires only the built-in library.
